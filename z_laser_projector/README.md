# ROS z_laser_projector Stack

The z_laser_projector stack is a set of tools that allow the user to operate the Z-LASER Projector [ZLP1](https://z-laser.com/en/product/laser-projector/zlp1/) and simplify the task of developing further advanced features, such as augmented reality applications. The stack provides a ROS API to control the device via topics and services, a visualizer for laser projections and a graphical interface.
